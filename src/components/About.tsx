            <p>
              I'm currently a 16 year old student from Slovakia studying Cybersecurity and Information Security, both of which I have been actively studying since the age of 11. I specialize in Security Research as well as Vulnerability Research and I'm interested in reverse engineering, cryptography as well as CyberOps!
              I play CTFs with Team Slovakia/Slovak Cyber Team, rakuz4n and 0xNOOB, where I specialize in reverse engineering and a little cryptography, due to my recent uprise in mathematical passion :D
            </p>
            <p>
            Fun things I've done over the years:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                ðŸ’¼ Cybersecurity Intern @ <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortinet</a> (Remote) â€” 2025â€“Present:
                    <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
                          <li>Architected and deployed complex digital infrastructures (VMware ESXi, FortiEDR, NGFW, FortiGate, FortiDeceptor, FortiAnalyzer...) for red team simulation and penetration testing.</li>
                          <li>Executed full-scope penetration tests against enterprise environments; simulated malware, network intrusions, and attacks on hardened endpoints.</li>
                          <li>Authored comprehensive internal reports on full attack chains, post-exploitation, and malware behavior for executive-level briefings.</li>
                          <li>Developed and executed malware and exploit scenarios; worked closely with senior SOC engineers from <a href="https://www.orange.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orange</a> on detection engineering and threat modeling.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                ðŸ”¬ Independent Malware Researcher and Analyst â€” 2023â€“Present:
                    <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
                            <li>Operate a production-grade <a href="https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T-POT honeypot</a> cluster with Kippo, Dionaea, and Cowrie to collect live malware strains from active threat actors.</li>
                            <li>Captured and reverse engineered over 150+ diverse malware strains.</li>
                            <li>Authored internal threat reports correlating malware behavior with MITRE ATT&CK techniques and infrastructure overlaps with known APT groups.</li>
                            <li>Rebuilt proprietary C2 protocols for isolated interaction, enabling behavioral analysis in a sandboxed environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Elected as a member of Team Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡° , primarily solving reverse engineering tasks with a secondary focus on crypto/forensics.</li> 
                <li>Founded and captained <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/383658" target="_blank">rakuz4n</a>, a CTF team consisting of players from teams from all across the world, with the intent on creating a friendly enviroment for collective learning and individual growth.</li>
                <li>Closely worked with private security researchers and veteran red teamers on the topics of penetration testing and malware development, where we specifically worked on innovative methods to extract SSNs without relying on incrementation and parsing the NTDLL.dll along with anti-sandbox techniques. One of our biggest researches was the attempted identification and termination of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_Patch_Protection" target="_blank">PatchGuard (KPP)</a> threads, in order to allow tampering with critical kernel structures, which as a result would drastically simplify the process of developing bootkits/rootkits.</li>
                <li>Led offensive team operations in custom labs against secured networks, where I focused on Active Directory, deploying a wide variety of sophisticated targeted attacks against Windows enviroments.</li>
                <li>Participated in cybersecurity competitions hosted by <a href="https://www.binaryconfidence.com/" target="_blank">Binary Confidence</a> - where I was elected the MVP of my team due to leadership skills, team contribution and coordination. Learned valuable and hands on skills from the areas of digital forensics, proactive and reactive incident response along with threat hunting.</li>
                <li>Placed in the top 10 of <a href="https://cybergame.sk/sk" target="_blank">CyberGame</a> 2025 - the national qualifier for Team Slovakia.</li> 
                <li>Independently authored and released an academic-style paper, pioneering five novel syscall evasion techniques that remained fully CET-compliant and bypassed three enterprise EDRs (MDE, Falcon, Singularity XDR) with >98% syscall coverage and zero detections. Shipped a reproducibility artifact with rigorously documented PoCs, statistical validation, and proposed mitigations, which ended up drawing attention from offensive engineers as well as from enterprise defenders for future collaboration.</li>
